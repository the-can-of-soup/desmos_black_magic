## Types in Desmos

### All Types
There are a lot of different types in Desmos. While most of the time we only use numbers, some other types can sometimes be very useful. Here is the list of types I know of, each with an example expression to produce them, sorted from easiest to hardest to manipulate:
* Number, `1 + 2`
* List, `[1, 2, 3]`
* Point, `(1, 2)`
* 3D Point, `(1, 2, 3)`
* Tone, `tone(440)`
* Polygon, `polygon([(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)])`
* Color, `rgb(255, 0, 0)`
* Action, `a -> 1`

### General Restrictions
* Attempting to use a non-number value in any comparison results in an error (before applying [list substitution](#list-substitution)).
* Attempting to pass a value of the wrong type to a built-in function results in an error, although some built-in functions accept multiple different types.
* Attempting to use two different types as the branches of a piecewise or the elements of a list results in an error.



## Number Magic

### Types of Numbers
There are generally four types of numbers: defined, `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN`. All types except defined show as `undefined` in vanilla Desmos, but their true type can be seen with the "Visual > Better Evaluation View > Advanced floating point" option in the [DesModder extension](https://www.desmodder.com/).

### Producing Undefined Numbers
`NaN` is what most undefined values are, but a couple special cases produce infinite values instead. `n / 0` produces `Infinity` for `n > 0`, and `-Infinity` for `n < 0`. For `n = 0`, this produces `NaN`. You can also create infinite values with the symbol `âˆž`, which can be typed with the shortcut `infty` or `infinity`. Finally, any number with a magnitude too large to be represented will be converted to `Infinity` or `-Infinity`.

### Negative 0
There is also a cursed number that exists called `-0`, which behaves exactly like `0`, except when you put it in the denominator, it flips the sign of the infinite number produced. This means that `n / -0` produces `-Infinity` for `n > 0`. `-0` shows up as `0` in vanilla Desmos unless you enable the "Advanced floating point" option in [DesModder](https://www.desmodder.com/) that I mentioned before.

### Differentiating Undefined Numbers
![Magic Level: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Magic_Level:-Easy-green?style=flat-square)

There are a few properties that can be used to differentiate between defined and undefined numbers. One very useful property is that `NaN` makes any conditional return false; i.e. `n = n` is true for any `n` except `NaN`. Infinite values are a bit harder to identify, but you can do so by checking `1 / n = 0`, which is only true for infinite values. To check the sign of the infinite value, you can just check `n > 0`, which is true for `Infinity`, but false for `-Infinity`.

### Differentiating Negative 0
![Magic Level: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Magic_Level:-Easy-green?style=flat-square)

The only method I know to differentiate `0` and `-0` is by dividing them from a nonzero `n`, which will produce either `Infinity` or `-Infinity`. The easiest check is `1 / n > 0`, which will be true for `0` and false for `-0`, because `1 / -0 = -Infinity`.



## List Magic

### List Restrictions
There are a few restrictions on lists in Desmos:
* Lists may not have greater than 10,000 elements.
* Lists must be of all the same type; i.e. you may not mix and match types.
* Lists may not contain lists or actions.
* Variables may not be set to lists containing `NaN` via actions.

### List Substitution
Lists can sometimes be used to substitute other values in expressions. For example, the expression `a^2 + 4` could be replaced with `[1, 2, 3]^2 + [4, 5, 6]` and still be valid syntax. Here is how Desmos evaluates this:

1. Identify substitutes in the equation. This is any list that would normally cause an error because lists are not supported in its position. It is important to note that this search is *equation-wide*, not confined to any specific sub-expression. Because of this, an expression that works on its own may not work when inserted into a larger one.
2. Find the length `L` of the shortest substitute. In the example, both substitutes are 3 elements long, so `L = 3`.
3. For every integer `n` from `1` to `L`, evaluate the expression, except replace each substitute `S` with `S[n]`. In the example, the expression would be evaluated as `[1, 2, 3][n]^2 + [4, 5, 6][n]` for every `n` from `1` to `3`.
4. Combine the results into a list and finish. The example would evaluate to `[5, 9, 15]`.

List substitution can sometimes lead to accidental and weird results. For example, the expression `{[1, 2, 3] = 1: 4, 5}` appears to be comparing the list `[1, 2, 3]` to the number `1` to see if they are equal. However, what is actually happening is because different types cannot be compared, this is actually checking each item in the list to see if it's equal to `1`, and so the expression evaluates to `[4, 5, 5]` instead of the expected `5`. This is even easier to stumble across if using variables, for example `{x = 1: 4, 5}` where `x = [1, 2, 3]` would produce the same result.

Another example of undesired list substitution would be the action `a -> {b = 1: a + 1, join(a, 1)}`, where `a` starts as a number. This action appears to increment `a` if `b = 1`, otherwise it will set `a` to the list `[a, 1]`. In reality, if `b = 1`, instead of incrementing `a`, it sets `a` to `[a + 1, a + 1]`. This is because a number and a list cannot be the branches of a piecewise, but `a + 1` is a number and `join(a, 1)` is a list. Therefore, this would've triggered an error, and therefore it triggers a substitution instead. Because `join(a, 1)` has 2 elements, the expression is evaluated twice.

### Differentiating Lists of Numbers From Numbers
![Magic Level: Difficult](https://img.shields.io/badge/Magic_Level:-Difficult-orange?style=flat-square)

It is very difficult to differentiate types because passing the wrong type to a function anywhere, even in branches that are never used, immediately makes the entire equation result in an error. There are two key properties that I used to achieve this:
* The `join()` function will accept *any type* except actions.
* Due to list substitution, it is valid syntax to compare a number to a list, and it is also valid to compare a list to a list.

The first step is to detect any lists that don't have exactly 1 item, which is fairly easy. We can use `join([], x)` to convert the value to a list. After converting to a list, if `x` is a number, we will get the list `[x]`. If `x` is a list, we will just get `x` back again. We then check the length of this list. If it is anything but 1, we immediately know that `x` is a list. So our function is: `isListOfNumbers(x) = {join([], x).length = 1: ..., 1}`.

The next step is to address the `...` in our function. If the length of `join([], x)` is 1, we know that `x` is either a number or a list of length 1. Differentiating the two is the hardest part of this function. For this, I use list substitution. If `x` is a number, evaluating `{x = [0, 0]: 0, 0}` will substitute each element of the list `[0, 0]` into the condition, and end up with two responses. However, if `x` is a list of length 1, `x` will now be *shorter than `[0, 0]`*, and so the Desmos list substitution algorithm will only substitute values until `x` is exhausted. Therefore, we only get one response, checking if the first element in `x` equals `0`. So the final step is to take this result and check its length. If it is `1`, we know `x` is a list, and if it is `2`, we know `x` is a number. So our final function is: `isListOfNumbers(x) = {join([], x).length = 1: {{x = [0, 0]: 0, 0}.length = 2: 0, 1}, 1}`.
